id like to start implementing local productivity setup. i run macos. i want to have an automation pipeline on n8n. i want to use opensource llm best for my use case. i want ot have rag on my obsidian notes vault. i want to be able to run opensource llm and prompt it to create custom project note - with summary of current active projects and unfinished tasks

I'd be happy to help you set up a local productivity system with the components you mentioned. Here's a plan to implement this on macOS:

Local Productivity System Overview
Your system will have these key components:

n8n for automation workflows
A local open-source LLM for AI capabilities
RAG integration with your Obsidian vault
A system to generate project summaries and task lists
Let's break down the implementation:

1. n8n Setup
First, install n8n on your Mac:

bash
# Using npm
npm install n8n -g
# OR using Docker
docker pull n8nio/n8n
To run n8n:

bash
# If installed via npm
n8n start
# OR via Docker
docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n
You'll access the n8n interface at http://localhost:5678

2. Open-Source LLM Selection
For your use case (productivity, note summarization, task management), I recommend:

Llama 3 8B or 70B: Great balance of performance and resource requirements
Mistral 7B: Efficient choice with good summarization capabilities
Phi-3 mini: Good for lightweight installations
To run these locally, you'll need:

LM Studio (very user-friendly)
Ollama (lightweight, command-line focused)
Install Ollama:

bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
Pull a model:

bash
ollama pull llama3
3. RAG for Obsidian
To implement RAG with your Obsidian vault:

Install LlamaIndex or LangChain
bash
pip install llama-index langchain
Create a script to index your Obsidian vault:
python
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader
import os

# Path to your Obsidian vault
OBSIDIAN_PATH = "/path/to/your/obsidian/vault"

# Load documents
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(OBSIDIAN_PATH, recursive=True).load_data()

# Create index
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)

# Save index
index.storage_context.persist("./obsidian_index")
4. Project Summary Generator
The final piece will be your n8n workflow that:

Triggers on schedule or demand
Queries your Obsidian vault via RAG
Prompts the LLM to create a summary
Here's a sample script to connect everything:

python
from llama_index import StorageContext, load_index_from_storage
from llama_index.llms import Ollama

# Load your saved index
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(persist_dir="./obsidian_index")
index = load_index_from_storage(storage_context)

# Connect to local LLM
llm = Ollama(model="llama3")

# Create query engine
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(llm=llm)

# Generate project summary
response = query_engine.query(
    "Create a summary of my current active projects and unfinished tasks. " +
    "Format it as a markdown document with sections for each project and bullet points for tasks."
)

# Save the response
with open("project_summary.md", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(response))
Integration Steps
First implementation: Set up Ollama and a basic RAG system
Create n8n workflows: Build automation that calls your script
Regular updates: Schedule the workflow to run daily/weekly
Refine: Improve prompts based on results
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this setup? For example, I could share more detailed n8n workflow configurations or help optimize the LLM choice for your specific hardware.

i want to use the same llm for all my n8n pipelines, prompting in terminal with tobbyml and as copilot in my lazyvim - i want to share the same context - so the same state of llm after prompting in terminal is used for rag and copilot

This is a great use case for maintaining a consistent LLM state across different interfaces. You'll want to set up a central LLM service that all your tools can connect to. Let me outline how to implement this:

Centralized LLM Setup with Shared Context
The key here is to run a single LLM instance as a service that your n8n workflows, terminal (tobbyml), and LazyVim copilot can all connect to, ensuring they share the same context and state.

1. Model Server with Shared State
I recommend using ollama as your central service since it:

Maintains state between queries
Provides a simple API interface
Has good performance on Mac
Can be easily connected to multiple clients
Here's how to set it up:

bash
# Install ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Pull a model that works well for coding and productivity
# Choose one based on your Mac's specifications:
ollama pull codellama:7b         # Good balance for M1/M2 Macs
# OR
ollama pull llama3:8b            # Good general purpose
# OR 
ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct  # Efficient instruction following
2. Run Ollama as a Service
bash
# Start ollama as a service (it runs on localhost:11434 by default)
ollama serve
3. Connect Tobby ML to Ollama
For terminal use with tobbyml:

bash
# Install tobby
pip install tobbyml

# Configure tobby to use your ollama endpoint
# Create a tobby config file if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.config/tobby
echo 'model_server: "http://localhost:11434"' > ~/.config/tobby/config.yaml
echo 'model: "codellama:7b"' >> ~/.config/tobby/config.yaml
4. LazyVim Copilot Setup
For LazyVim, you can use copilot.lua with ollama:

Add this to your LazyVim config:
lua
return {
  {
    "zbirenbaum/copilot.lua",
    cmd = "Copilot",
    event = "InsertEnter",
    config = function()
      require("copilot").setup({
        suggestion = { enabled = false },
        panel = { enabled = false },
        server_opts_overrides = {
          -- Connect to your local Ollama instance
          inlineSuggestCount = 3,
          alternative_lsp = {
            type = "ollama",
            url = "http://localhost:11434",
            model = "codellama:7b", -- Use the same model as tobby
          }
        }
      })
    end,
  }
}
5. n8n Integration with Ollama
Create a workflow in n8n that connects to the same Ollama instance:

Use the "HTTP Request" node to connect to Ollama's API:
Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:11434/api/generate
Body (JSON):
json
{
  "model": "codellama:7b",
  "prompt": "{{$input.prompt}}",
  "stream": false
}
Create a workflow for your RAG system:

n8n RAG Workflow Code
Code 
6. Tying Everything Together
The critical advantage of this setup is that all tools share the same LLM instance:

If you reference a project in the terminal with tobbyml, the LLM retains that context
When LazyVim copilot suggests code, it has awareness of what you've discussed
Your n8n workflows can continue the same contextual thread
For optimal results, configure your Ollama instance to maintain longer context:

bash
# Start ollama with increased context window
OLLAMA_HOST=localhost:11434 OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=1h ollama serve
Would you like me to provide more specific implementation details for any part of this setup? For example, I could help with optimizing Ollama's parameters for better performance on your Mac or developing more sophisticated RAG queries for your Obsidian vault.

i dont see rag llamaindex in this setup

You're absolutely right - I didn't include the LlamaIndex RAG integration properly in the centralized setup. Let me correct this with a more complete architecture that incorporates LlamaIndex for proper RAG on your Obsidian vault.

Improved Centralized Setup with LlamaIndex RAG
Here's the revised architecture that ensures all components share the same LLM instance:

1. Ollama as Central LLM Service (same as before)
bash
# Install and run Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull codellama:7b  # or your preferred model
ollama serve
2. LlamaIndex RAG for Obsidian
First, install LlamaIndex with the Ollama integration:

bash
pip install llama-index langchain pymupdf pypdf
pip install llama-index-llms-ollama
Now create a script to build and query your RAG index:

python
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader, ServiceContext
from llama_index.llms import Ollama
import os

# Path to your Obsidian vault
OBSIDIAN_PATH = "/path/to/your/obsidian/vault"

def create_index():
    # Load documents from Obsidian vault
    documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(OBSIDIAN_PATH, recursive=True).load_data()
    
    # Connect to your running Ollama instance
    llm = Ollama(model="codellama:7b", url="http://localhost:11434")
    
    # Create service context with the Ollama LLM
    service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(llm=llm)
    
    # Create and save index
    index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(
        documents, 
        service_context=service_context
    )
    
    # Save index
    index.storage_context.persist("./obsidian_index")
    return index

def query_index(query_text):
    # Load your saved index
    from llama_index import StorageContext, load_index_from_storage
    
    # Connect to Ollama
    llm = Ollama(model="codellama:7b", url="http://localhost:11434")
    service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(llm=llm)
    
    # Load index with the same LLM
    storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(persist_dir="./obsidian_index")
    index = load_index_from_storage(storage_context, service_context=service_context)
    
    # Create query engine
    query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
    
    # Query
    response = query_engine.query(query_text)
    return str(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create index if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists("./obsidian_index"):
        create_index()
    
    # Example query
    result = query_index("Summarize my current projects and tasks")
    print(result)
3. n8n Integration with LlamaIndex RAG
Now, let's create a proper n8n workflow that uses this LlamaIndex setup:

Install the n8n Python package to create a custom node:
bash
npm install n8n-python
Create a custom n8n node that calls your RAG script:

n8n LlamaIndex RAG Integration
Code 
Modify your Python script to accept command-line arguments:

LlamaIndex RAG Script with CLI Support
Code 
4. Create a Project Summary Generator Script
Here's a script that combines the RAG system with a project summary generator:


Project Summary Generator Script
Code 
5. Complete Integration
Now let's tie everything together to ensure all components share the same LLM context:

Create a startup script:

Productivity System Startup Script
Code 
Set up tobbyml to use the same Ollama instance:
Create a ~/.config/tobby/config.yaml file:

yaml
model_server: "http://localhost:11434"
model: "codellama:7b"
Configure LazyVim's copilot plugin to use the same Ollama instance as described earlier.
6. Create an n8n Workflow for Project Summary Generation
In n8n, create a scheduled workflow:

Schedule Trigger - Set to run daily or on demand
Execute Command - Run the project summary script
Send Outputs - Options to:
Save to your Obsidian vault
Send via email
Display in a dashboard
Final Integration Points
This architecture now properly integrates:

Single Ollama LLM instance shared by all components
LlamaIndex RAG properly indexing your Obsidian vault
n8n workflows that leverage both components
Terminal access via tobbyml connected to the same LLM
Editor integration with LazyVim using the shared LLM
The key advantage is that context is maintained across all interfaces. For example, if you discuss a project in your terminal, that context is available when you create a summary through n8n or when using copilot features in LazyVim.

Would you like me to provide more specific details on any part of this setup? For example, I could help with optimizing the LlamaIndex configuration for better performance with your Obsidian vault.

i want my eperience with llm as near to what i have with claudeai as possible - in the same time i want it free and light fast - what llm i shall use than?

To get an experience similar to Claude AI while keeping it free, local, and fast, you'll want to carefully choose your local LLM. Here are the best options for a Claude-like experience while maintaining performance:

Best Local LLMs for Claude-like Experience
Mistral 7B Instruct - Excellent balance of speed and quality
Great at following instructions
Reasonable on M1/M2 Macs
Needs about 8GB of RAM
Llama 3 8B - Very well-rounded performer
Good reasoning abilities
Decent context understanding
Similar "feel" to Claude in conversation
Runs smoothly on modern Macs
Phi-3 Mini - If speed is critical
Surprisingly capable for its size
Very fast responses
Lower resource requirements
Good at coding tasks
Gemma 7B - Worth considering
Clean responses
Good instruction following
Works well with RAG systems
Recommended Setup for Best Claude-like Experience
I'd recommend this configuration:

bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Pull Llama 3 8B - best balance of Claude-like quality and speed
ollama pull llama3:8b

# OR if you need even faster responses with slightly lower quality
ollama pull mistral
Then optimize the Ollama configuration for better performance:

bash
# Run with increased context and performance settings
OLLAMA_HOST=localhost:11434 OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=5h ollama serve
For your workflow integrations (n8n, LazyVim, terminal), use these models with the RAG setup described earlier, and you'll get the closest experience to Claude while keeping everything free, local, and reasonably fast.

The main trade-offs to be aware of:

Local models will have shorter context windows than Claude
Response quality won't be quite at Claude's level
You'll need to handle more prompt engineering yourself
Would you like me to provide more specific optimization techniques for your selected model to get even closer to the Claude experience?

yes, help me - im not good in prompting

I'd be happy to help improve your prompting for local LLMs to get a more Claude-like experience. Good prompting can significantly enhance local model performance.

Prompting Techniques for Local LLMs
1. System Prompts for Local Models
Create a system prompt file (system_prompt.txt) to use with all your tools:

You are a helpful, accurate, and friendly AI assistant similar to Claude. You think step-by-step before answering. You prioritize being helpful while maintaining accuracy. When you're uncertain, acknowledge your limitations. Respond in a conversational, thoughtful manner.

When helping with tasks:
1. Break down complex problems into steps
2. Provide clear explanations for your reasoning
3. If coding, include comments to explain your approach
4. Focus on providing practical solutions

Always maintain context from our conversation. If I refer to something we discussed earlier, use that information in your response.
2. Task-Specific Prompt Templates
Here are templates for different tasks with your local LLM:

For Summarizing Projects (n8n workflow):
I need a summary of my current projects.

Use these guidelines:
1. Review the context provided from my notes
2. List active projects with 1-2 sentence descriptions
3. For each project, identify 3-5 key unfinished tasks
4. Highlight any approaching deadlines
5. Format as a clean markdown document with clear sections

Context from my notes:
{context}
For Code Assistance (LazyVim):
As a coding assistant, help me with the following task:

Project context: {project_description}
Current file: {filename}
Task: {coding_task}

Please provide code that is:
- Well-commented
- Following best practices for {language}
- Easy to understand and maintain

Think step-by-step about the solution before providing code.
For RAG Queries:
I'm looking for information from my notes.

Query: {query}

When answering:
1. Focus only on information found in my notes
2. If multiple notes contain relevant information, synthesize them
3. If information seems incomplete, note what might be missing
4. Format your response in a clean, readable way

Notes context:
{note_context}
3. Implementation in Your Tools
For n8n workflows:

n8n Prompt Helper Function
Code 
For terminal use with tobbyml:
Create a set of prompt shortcuts in a file ~/.config/tobby/prompts.yaml:

yaml
prompts:
  summarize: |
    Summarize the following information concisely:
    
    {input}
  
  explain_code: |
    Explain what the following code does in simple terms:
    
    {input}
  
  improve_code: |
    Review the following code and suggest improvements for readability and efficiency:
    
    {input}
  
  brainstorm: |
    Help me brainstorm ideas about:
    
    {input}
    
    Generate 5-7 creative possibilities with brief explanations.
4. Chain-of-Thought Techniques
Local LLMs perform better with chain-of-thought prompting. Add these elements to your prompts:

When responding to this request:
1. First, think about what information you need to address the question
2. Second, analyze the key aspects of the problem
3. Third, develop your answer step by step
4. Finally, summarize your conclusion clearly

This helps me understand your reasoning process.
5. Optimization for RAG
For RAG queries with LlamaIndex, improve results with this approach:


Optimized RAG Query Function
Code 
6. Making Your LLM More "Claude-like"
To make your local LLM respond more like Claude:

Instruct it to be thoughtful and nuanced:
When answering, consider multiple perspectives and provide nuanced responses rather than simplistic answers. Acknowledge complexity where it exists.
Encourage helpful behaviors:
If my request isn't clear, ask clarifying questions before proceeding. If I request something you can't do well, suggest a better approach.
For coding tasks:
When writing code, follow these principles:
- Write clean, well-structured code
- Include detailed comments explaining your approach
- Break complex functions into smaller, manageable pieces
- Consider edge cases and error handling
Practical Example: Project Summary Workflow
Here's a complete example of how to generate a project summary with Claude-like responses:


Claude-like Project Summary Script
Code 
Would you like me to focus on any specific aspect of prompting or provide additional templates for other use cases in your productivity system?

im starting from the initial setp - shall i run those things in conda env?

Starting from the beginning with a clean setup is a good approach. Using a conda environment is an excellent choice for managing your Python dependencies without affecting your system. Here's how to set up your entire productivity system from scratch using conda:

Initial Setup with Conda
First, install Miniconda if you don't have it already:
bash
# Download the installer
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.pkg  # For M1/M2 Macs
# Or for Intel Macs
# curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg

# Install it
sudo installer -pkg Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.pkg -target /
Create a dedicated conda environment:
bash
# Create a new environment
conda create -n productivity python=3.10

# Activate it
conda activate productivity
Install the necessary Python packages:
bash
# Basic packages
conda install -c conda-forge pip numpy pandas

# Install LlamaIndex and other needed packages
pip install llama-index pymupdf pypdf
pip install llama-index-llms-ollama
pip install langchain
Install Ollama
Ollama needs to be installed at the system level (not in the conda environment):

bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
Then pull your chosen model:

bash
# Pull Llama 3 8B - good balance of performance and quality
ollama pull llama3:8b
Setup n8n
For n8n, you can use npm or Docker. Here's the npm approach:

bash
# Install n8n globally
npm install n8n -g

# Start n8n
n8n start
Create Your Project Directory Structure
bash
# Create project directory
mkdir -p ~/llm_productivity
cd ~/llm_productivity

# Create subdirectories
mkdir -p scripts config data indices
Create Configuration Files
Create a basic configuration file:

bash
# In the config directory
cat > config/settings.json << EOL
{
  "obsidian_vault_path": "/path/to/your/obsidian/vault",
  "llm_model": "llama3:8b",
  "llm_url": "http://localhost:11434",
  "index_dir": "./indices/obsidian_index"
}
EOL
Create a Basic RAG Script
bash
# In the scripts directory
touch scripts/build_index.py
Now edit the file with your favorite editor and add:

python
# scripts/build_index.py
import json
import os
import sys
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader, ServiceContext
from llama_index.llms import Ollama

# Load config
with open("config/settings.json", "r") as f:
    config = json.load(f)

OBSIDIAN_PATH = config["obsidian_vault_path"]
INDEX_DIR = config["index_dir"]

def create_index():
    print("Building index from Obsidian vault...")
    # Check if Obsidian path exists
    if not os.path.exists(OBSIDIAN_PATH):
        print(f"Error: Obsidian vault path {OBSIDIAN_PATH} does not exist")
        sys.exit(1)
        
    # Load documents from Obsidian vault
    documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(OBSIDIAN_PATH, recursive=True).load_data()
    print(f"Loaded {len(documents)} documents")
    
    # Connect to Ollama
    llm = Ollama(model=config["llm_model"], url=config["llm_url"])
    
    # Create service context
    service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(llm=llm)
    
    # Create and save index
    index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(
        documents, 
        service_context=service_context
    )
    
    # Create directory if it doesn't exist
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(INDEX_DIR), exist_ok=True)
    
    # Save index
    index.storage_context.persist(INDEX_DIR)
    print(f"Index created successfully at {INDEX_DIR}")
    return index

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_index()

bash
touch scripts/query_notes.py
Add the following content:

Generate a project summary:
bash
python scripts/generate_summary.py
Access n8n at http://localhost:5678 to set up your workflows
This gives you a complete, well-organized system that runs in a conda environment. The conda environment isolates your Python dependencies, making the system more stable and avoiding conflicts with other Python applications on your Mac.

Would you like me to explain how to set up specific n8n workflows next, or would you prefer help with another aspect of the system?

NoWritableEnvsDirError: No writeable envs directories configured.
  - /Users/unman/.conda/envs
  - /opt/miniconda3/envs

It looks like you're encountering a permission issue with conda. This is a common problem with conda environments when the environment directories aren't writable by your user. Let's fix this issue and then proceed with setting up your productivity system.

Fixing the Conda Environment Permission Issue
There are several approaches to solve this problem:

Option 1: Create a writable envs directory in your home folder
bash
# Create a conda environments directory in your home folder
mkdir -p ~/.conda/envs

# Configure conda to use this directory
conda config --add envs_dirs ~/.conda/envs
Option 2: Fix permissions on the existing directories
bash
# Check ownership of the directories
ls -la /opt/miniconda3/envs
ls -la ~/.conda/envs

# Fix permissions if needed
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.conda/envs
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /opt/miniconda3/envs
Option 3: Use a different environment management tool
If you continue having issues with conda, you might want to consider using Python's built-in venv instead:

bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv ~/llm_productivity/env

# Activate it
source ~/llm_productivity/env/bin/activate
Try Creating the Environment Again
After fixing the permissions, try creating the environment again:

bash
# Create the environment
conda create -n productivity python=3.10

# Activate it
conda activate productivity
If you're still having issues, let's try a slightly different approach:

bash
# Create a new environment in a specific location you control
conda create --prefix ~/llm_productivity/conda_env python=3.10

# Activate it
conda activate ~/llm_productivity/conda_env
Once you've successfully created and activated the environment, you can proceed with installing the necessary packages and setting up your productivity system as outlined in my previous message.

Let me know which approach worked for you, and we can proceed with the next steps.

venv worked

Great! Now that you have a working virtual environment with venv, let's continue setting up your productivity system. Here's how to proceed:

Continue Setup with Your Python venv
First, make sure your virtual environment is activated:
bash
source ~/llm_productivity/env/bin/activate
Install the necessary Python packages:
bash
# Install basic packages
pip install numpy pandas

# Install LlamaIndex and other needed packages
pip install llama-index pymupdf pypdf
pip install llama-index-llms-ollama
pip install langchain
Install Ollama
Install Ollama at the system level (outside your venv):

bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
Then pull your chosen model:

bash
# Pull Llama 3 8B for a good balance of performance and quality
ollama pull llama3:8b
Setup n8n
Install n8n using npm:

bash
# Install n8n globally
npm install n8n -g

# Or if you prefer to keep it isolated
npm install n8n --prefix ~/llm_productivity/node_modules
Project Directory Setup
Now let's create your project structure:

bash
# Create project directory structure
mkdir -p ~/llm_productivity/{scripts,config,data,indices}
cd ~/llm_productivity
Configuration Files
Create your basic configuration:

bash
# Create config directory
mkdir -p config

# Create settings file
cat > config/settings.json << EOL
{
  "obsidian_vault_path": "/path/to/your/obsidian/vault",
  "llm_model": "llama3:8b",
  "llm_url": "http://localhost:11434",
  "index_dir": "./indices/obsidian_index"
}
EOL
Make sure to edit the "obsidian_vault_path" to point to your actual Obsidian vault.

Create the Python Scripts
Create the same Python scripts I detailed in my previous message:

The indexing script:
bash
touch scripts/build_index.py
The query script:
bash
touch scripts/query_notes.py
The summary generator:
bash
touch scripts/generate_summary.py
Edit each file and add the Python code I provided earlier.

Create Your Startup Script
bash
touch start_system.sh
chmod +x start_system.sh
Edit the startup script to use venv instead of conda:

bash
#!/bin/bash
# start_system.sh - Start your productivity system

# Function to check if a process is running
is_running() {
  pgrep -f "$1" >/dev/null
  return $?
}

# Go to the project directory
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

# Activate virtual environment
source env/bin/activate

# Check if Ollama is running
if ! is_running "ollama"; then
  echo "Starting Ollama service..."
  OLLAMA_HOST=localhost:11434 OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=5h ollama serve &
  sleep 5  # Give it time to start
fi

# Check if the index exists, build if needed
if [ ! -d "./indices/obsidian_index" ]; then
  echo "Building Obsidian index..."
  python scripts/build_index.py
fi

# Start n8n if needed and not already running
if ! is_running "n8n"; then
  echo "Starting n8n..."
  n8n start &
  sleep 5
fi

echo "Productivity system is ready!"
echo "- Ollama running at http://localhost:11434"
echo "- n8n available at http://localhost:5678"
echo
echo "Commands:"
echo "  python scripts/query_notes.py 'your query'"
echo "  python scripts/generate_summary.py"
Setting Up tobbyml Configuration
bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/tobby
cat > ~/.config/tobby/config.yaml << EOL
model_server: "http://localhost:11434"
model: "llama3:8b"
EOL
Running Your System
Start your productivity system:
bash
# From your project directory
./start_system.sh
Test querying your notes:
bash
python scripts/query_notes.py "What are my current projects?"
Generate a project summary:
bash
python scripts/generate_summary.py
Access n8n at http://localhost:5678 to set up your workflows
Using venv instead of conda gives you a lighter setup that's still isolated from your system Python. Everything else should work just as described in my previous message.

Is there a specific part of the system you'd like me to explain in more detail, or would you like help with creating an n8n workflow for your productivity system?

starting from install ollama - remember im not on linux but macos

You're right, let me adjust the instructions specifically for macOS since there are some differences. Let's start from the Ollama installation step:

Install Ollama on macOS
For macOS, you can download and install Ollama from the official website or use Homebrew:

bash
# Option 1: Using Homebrew
brew install ollama

# Option 2: Direct download
# Visit https://ollama.com/download and download the macOS installer
After installation, pull your chosen model:

bash
# Pull Llama 3 8B for a good balance of performance and quality
ollama pull llama3:8b
Setup n8n on macOS
Install n8n using npm:

bash
# Install Node.js first if you don't have it
brew install node

# Then install n8n globally
npm install n8n -g

# Or if you prefer to keep it isolated
npm install n8n --prefix ~/llm_productivity/node_modules
Project Directory Setup
Create your project structure:

bash
# Create project directory structure
mkdir -p ~/llm_productivity/{scripts,config,data,indices}
cd ~/llm_productivity
Configuration Files
Create your basic configuration:

bash
# Create config directory
mkdir -p config

# Create settings file using your favorite text editor, or:
cat > config/settings.json << EOL
{
  "obsidian_vault_path": "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/Obsidian/YourVaultName",
  "llm_model": "llama3:8b",
  "llm_url": "http://localhost:11434",
  "index_dir": "./indices/obsidian_index"
}
EOL
Make sure to replace YOUR_USERNAME and YourVaultName with your actual macOS username and Obsidian vault name.

Create the Python Scripts
Create the same Python scripts I detailed earlier. You can use TextEdit, VS Code, or any editor you prefer:

For the indexing script, create scripts/build_index.py
For the query script, create scripts/query_notes.py
For the summary generator, create scripts/generate_summary.py
Add the Python code I provided earlier to each file.

Create Your Startup Script (macOS version)
bash
touch start_system.sh
chmod +x start_system.sh
Edit the startup script with macOS-specific commands:

bash
#!/bin/bash
# start_system.sh - Start your productivity system on macOS

# Function to check if a process is running
is_running() {
  pgrep -f "$1" >/dev/null
  return $?
}

# Go to the project directory
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

# Activate virtual environment
source env/bin/activate

# Check if Ollama is running
if ! is_running "ollama"; then
  echo "Starting Ollama service..."
  open -a Ollama
  # OR for command line version: 
  # ollama serve &
  sleep 5  # Give it time to start
fi

# Check if the index exists, build if needed
if [ ! -d "./indices/obsidian_index" ]; then
  echo "Building Obsidian index..."
  python scripts/build_index.py
fi

# Start n8n if needed and not already running
if ! is_running "n8n"; then
  echo "Starting n8n..."
  n8n start &
  sleep 5
fi

echo "Productivity system is ready!"
echo "- Ollama running at http://localhost:11434"
echo "- n8n available at http://localhost:5678"
echo
echo "Commands:"
echo "  python scripts/query_notes.py 'your query'"
echo "  python scripts/generate_summary.py"
Setting Up tobbyml Configuration

bash
python scripts/query_notes.py "What are my current projects?"
Generate a project summary:
bash
python scripts/generate_summary.py
Access n8n at http://localhost:5678 to set up your workflows
The main differences for macOS are:

The Ollama installation method
The paths for your Obsidian vault
The way processes are started (using open -a for GUI apps)
Do you want me to help with any specific part of this setup, or would you like guidance on creating n8n workflows next?

the results are very disapointing.  project summary report is like this # Project Status Summary
Generated: 2025-04-11
Project Status Report
As of 2025-04-11
# ACTIVE PROJECTS:
There are no active projects mentioned in your notes. It appears that these documents may be related to research papers or academic studies, rather than actual projects.
# PRIORITY TASKS:
Since there are no active projects, there are no priority tasks to report. However, if you'd like to discuss potential priorities based on the topics covered in the documents, please let me know!
# BLOCKED ITEMS:
There are no blocked items reported in your notes.
# RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
Unfortunately, since these documents appear to be related to research papers, there are no recent accomplishments to report.
# UPCOMING DEADLINES:
There are no upcoming deadlines mentioned in your notes.
That's all for this project status report! If you have any questions or would like me to help with anything else, please let me know.

I understand your disappointment with the summary results. This is a common challenge when first setting up RAG systems with local LLMs. Let's troubleshoot and improve your results:

Troubleshooting the RAG System
There are several possible issues:

Document parsing issues: The system might not be properly extracting content from your Obsidian notes
Index quality issues: The vector embeddings might not be capturing the relationships well
Query construction issues: The prompts might not be effective for the local model
Model limitations: Local models have smaller context windows than Claude
Let's address these one by one:

1. First, let's check if your notes are being properly indexed:
bash
# Add this debugging script
touch scripts/debug_index.py
Add this content to the script:

python
# scripts/debug_index.py
import json
import os
import sys
from llama_index import SimpleDirectoryReader

# Load config
with open("config/settings.json", "r") as f:
    config = json.load(f)

OBSIDIAN_PATH = config["obsidian_vault_path"]

def debug_index():
    print(f"Checking Obsidian vault at {OBSIDIAN_PATH}...")
    
    # Check if path exists
    if not os.path.exists(OBSIDIAN_PATH):
        print(f"Error: Obsidian vault path {OBSIDIAN_PATH} does not exist")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    # List all markdown files
    md_files = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(OBSIDIAN_PATH):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.md'):
                md_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))
    
    print(f"Found {len(md_files)} markdown files")
    
    # Try to load documents
    documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(OBSIDIAN_PATH, recursive=True).load_data()
    print(f"Successfully loaded {len(documents)} documents")
    
    # Print sample content from the first few documents
    for i, doc in enumerate(documents[:3]):
        print(f"\nDocument {i+1} sample:")
        print("-" * 50)
        print(doc.text[:300] + "...")
        print("-" * 50)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    debug_index()
Run this script to see if your documents are being loaded correctly:

bash
python scripts/debug_index.py
2. Improved RAG System
Let's improve your RAG system with better prompt handling and document processing:

bash
# Create an improved summary generator
touch scripts/improved_summary.py
Add this content:

python
# scripts/improved_summary.py
import json
import os
import sys
import datetime
from llama_index import StorageContext, load_index_from_storage, ServiceContext
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader
from llama_index.llms import Ollama
from llama_index.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Load config
with open("config/settings.json", "r") as f:
    config = json.load(f)

OBSIDIAN_PATH = config["obsidian_vault_path"]
INDEX_DIR = config["index_dir"]

def rebuild_index():
    print("Rebuilding index from Obsidian vault...")
    
    # Load documents from Obsidian vault
    documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(
        OBSIDIAN_PATH, 
        recursive=True,
        filename_as_id=True,
        required_exts=[".md"]
    ).load_data()
    
    print(f"Loaded {len(documents)} documents")
    
    # Connect to Ollama
    llm = Ollama(model=config["llm_model"], url=config["llm_url"])
    
    # Create service context
    service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(llm=llm)
    
    # Create and save index
    index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(
        documents, 
        service_context=service_context
    )
    
    # Create directory if it doesn't exist
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(INDEX_DIR), exist_ok=True)
    
    # Save index
    index.storage_context.persist(INDEX_DIR)
    print(f"Index rebuilt successfully at {INDEX_DIR}")
    return index

def generate_project_summary():
    # Check if index exists
    if not os.path.exists(INDEX_DIR):
        print(f"Index not found at {INDEX_DIR}. Building it now...")
        rebuild_index()
    
    print("Generating improved project summary...")
    
    # Connect to Ollama
    llm = Ollama(model=config["llm_model"], url=config["llm_url"])
    service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(llm=llm)
    
    # Load index
    storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(persist_dir=INDEX_DIR)
    index = load_index_from_storage(storage_context, service_context=service_context)
    
    # Use a very specific summary prompt template
    summary_prompt_tmpl = PromptTemplate(
        """\

    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(markdown_output)
    
    print(f"Improved project summary saved to {output_file}")
    return output_file

if __name__ == "__main__":
    generate_project_summary()
3. Check Your Obsidian Structure
For best results with the RAG system, your Obsidian vault should have:

Clear task markers: Use - [ ] for tasks or TODO: markers
Project organization: Consider having project-specific folders or tags
Frontmatter: Add YAML frontmatter to key notes with status: fields
If your vault doesn't have these, you might want to create a few test notes with clear project/task formats.

4. Try a Direct Query Approach
Let's also create a more direct query tool that doesn't rely as heavily on the RAG index:

bash
touch scripts/direct_query.py
Add this content:

python
# scripts/direct_query.py
import json
import os
import sys
from llama_index import SimpleDirectoryReader
from llama_index.llms import Ollama

# Load config
with open("config/settings.json", "r") as f:
    config = json.load(f)

OBSIDIAN_PATH = config["obsidian_vault_path"]

def direct_query(query_type="projects"):
    print(f"Performing direct query for {query_type}...")
    
    # Load documents directly
    documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(
        OBSIDIAN_PATH, 
        recursive=True,
        required_exts=[".md"]
    ).load_data()
    
    print(f"Loaded {len(documents)} documents")
    
    # Connect to Ollama
    llm = Ollama(model=config["llm_model"], url=config["llm_url"])
    
    # Collect text from all documents
    all_text = ""
    for doc in documents:
        # Only add text containing keywords for efficiency
        if query_type == "projects":
            if "project" in doc.text.lower() or "task" in doc.text.lower() or "todo" in doc.text.lower():
                all_text += doc.text + "\n\n"
        else:
            all_text += doc.text + "\n\n"
    
    # Truncate if too long - adjust for your model's context window
    max_chars = 10000  # Adjust based on your model's capabilities
    if len(all_text) > max_chars:
        all_text = all_text[:max_chars]
    
    # Create prompt based on query type
    if query_type == "projects":
        prompt = f"""
Based on these notes, identify all projects and tasks:

{all_text}

Please list:
1. All projects mentioned
2. Tasks associated with each project
3. Any deadlines mentioned

Format the response as a well-structured markdown document.
"""
    
    # Get response from LLM
    response = llm.complete(prompt)
    
    # Print and save response
    print("\n" + str(response) + "\n")
    
    # Save to file
    output_dir = "data/direct_queries"
    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    output_file = f"{output_dir}/{query_type}_query.md"
    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(str(response))
    
    print(f"Response saved to {output_file}")
    return output_file

if __name__ == "__main__":
    query_type = "projects"
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        query_type = sys.argv[1]
    
    direct_query(query_type)
Run this tool to try a direct approach:

bash
python scripts/direct_query.py
5. Try a Different Model
If you're still getting disappointing results, consider trying a different model that might handle your use case better:

bash
# Try Mistral 7B, which is often good with task extraction
ollama pull mistral
Then update your config/settings.json file to use this model instead:

json
{
  "obsidian_vault_path": "/path/to/your/obsidian/vault",
  "llm_model": "mistral",
  "llm_url": "http://localhost:11434",
  "index_dir": "./indices/obsidian_index"
}
6. Sample Note Structure
If your notes aren't structured in a way that makes projects and tasks explicit, consider adding a few test notes with this structure:

markdown
---
status: active
type: project
priority: high
deadline: 2025-05-01
---

# Project Name

## Description
Brief description of the project

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1 - Due: 2025-04-20
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Blocked task - waiting for XYZ
- [ ] Next task

## Notes
Additional project notes here.
With these improvements, you should get much better results from your project summary tool. The key is making sure your notes have explicit project and task information and that the RAG system is effectively extracting this information.

Would you like me to help with any particular aspect of these improvements?
