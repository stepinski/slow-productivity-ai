kickoff with mike 18.12.24
#### Key Points:
1. **Dashboarding for Peel**:
    - Discussed concepts and mockups for a new dashboard for FlowWorks.
    - Objective: Create an entry point in FlowWorks to expand functionality and appeal to different user personas.
    - Focused on Imran's use case at Peel (sewer network monitoring), with considerations for future personas (e.g., Brandon at Flowmetrix for data quality and Jason Miller at KWL for creek and river monitoring).
2. **Action Items**:
    - Develop dashboard mockups tailored for Peel's operational needs.
    - Plan to address specific user requirements for different personas in future iterations.
    - Schedule calls to resolve potential authentication issues.
3. **Next Steps**:    
    - Preliminary planning with team members (e.g., Mj, Kuba, Dominika) before Christmas.
    - Further discussions in the new year, with specific agenda items for next stages of dashboard development.
#### Notes:

- Current focus remains on Peel's use case with plans to broaden functionality later.
- Team alignment and planning to continue into the new year with holiday schedules in mind.
