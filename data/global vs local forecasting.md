there is mind blowing idea from functime regarding local forecasting
- it's never a winning forecasting competition 
- functime is global only as it lets you save the cloud money
- very rarely you need to scale with databricks
------
my thoughts:
- tesler is an engeneer centric tool - you may run local models like swmm -> something that is impossible to run anywere else@@@
- tesler might not be a good fit for forecasting problems as long as they can't beat the global algo
- tesler anomaly detection might be good to test using global aproach - try to implement it in functime
- try to test pattern anomaly detection for our cases
- try to implement pattern models in functime approach
