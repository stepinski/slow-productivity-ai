MVP  - UI/UX feature using flags and suggested values to save time/improve results

-   Using FACE for updates takes too much time​
	- Refresh/update slow​
	- Difficult “painful” process​
	- Sometimes easier to use import/export (into other app)​
-   Suggestion by client:​
	-  Allow edits on same page to build final channel​
	-  Reduce lag time in application​
	-  Have Algorithm “learn” through changes (AKA Feedback Loop)​
	
-   GJ thoughts:​
	-   Inline editor would be popular and easy – but – replacement values must have some formula applied (i.e. derived from channel(s) using logic or domain expertise)​
	-   Feedback loop of little or no use if replacement point solutions are random (would forcing formula’s help this???)​
	-   Use Flowscript or Tesler to reduce channels/transformations to reduce lag(???)
