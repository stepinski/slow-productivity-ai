- isolation forests is a ML model  - example of unsupervised learning
- good for anomaly detection problems
- similar to decision trees - we have many decision trees that we train in parallel
- intuition behind anomaly detection - anomalous classes are less numerous than others and are most likely detected in shortest paths
