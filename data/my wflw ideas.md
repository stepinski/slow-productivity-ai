nomad is a source of note taking - must be auto syncing to obsidian
- dont know yet how to make issues out of this - are issues the way we manage projects? kanbans in github and issues done there? if yes - how to marry it with obisidian notes, PARA, callendar? 
- cal n. idea is to keep every project as kanban board on trello - that's it - this works for him - as long as there is no person related to the task, it's only an idea - 
- maybe having concept of epic, story and item is something that may help here? do i need it?

I had a concept of different workflows from SN to other systems:
- assuming I do PARA on SN for simplicity - I can connect my notes through tags? - assuming  I can do this in SN - this is my minimial path  - shall I add this thing? - isn't it overcomplicated?
- the best scenario is that from a bunch of notes, transcripts and emails I have a workflow that automatically prepares me backlog and updates it each time I run it. Backlog than becomes a Kanban board in any tools that's convenient. 
- => might be moved into github issues kanban ( as for today I don't have anything better)
- => if the project structure is strictly kept by taging than I less get the structure from AI context - I prepose it on the data and if anything happens it might be considered to be due to my previus intervention, not AI itself.
	- for the converence I need to prove that it's an AI agentic workflow
