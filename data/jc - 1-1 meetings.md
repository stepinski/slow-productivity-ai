we discussed my comments to strategy meetings notes:
My comments are related to the 'Repositioning Presentation' in the following sections:
- FacePro as an ETL tool: _'Infinitii FacePro: Positioning Externally and Internally'_
- FACE functions: _'Infinitii FacePro: Positioning Externally'_
- SWMM as a Service: _'Slide 13 - More Applications'_"
-----------------------
FACE functions ideas:
- outlier detection
- outlier removal / data imputation
- simple forecasting - ARIMA / SARIMA
- parts of IandI - like dry weather pattern
- rain finder -> function that is used in IandI that merges many small rains into longer rain event
- cumulative rain
