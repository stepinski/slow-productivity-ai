For City of Toronto, there are two separate monitoring projects – one for the trunk sewers, and one for the local sewers.

Attached is a sheet for the trunk sewers project with a set of sites, channels, and the amount of data in each. I have filtered out sites with less than 2 years of data. It also includes a tab for the rain gauge sources in the same format as provided previously. Tomasz has the GIS data for the trunk sewer project.

The local sewers project does not have enough data yet – no sites have more than 2 years. Tomasz has GIS data for this project to, since it overlaps the same geographic area and may provide some value.

Let me know if you have any questions.
