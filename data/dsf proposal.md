|Forecasting time-series with Arrow and WASM|
|**Session abstract**|   |
||This session is a presentation of novel concept of time-series processing pipeline for MLOps  <br>- Apache arrow + s3 in backed to process large number of large files  <br>- polars or duckdb for data manipulation  <br>- super fast task runner written in Rust  <br>- WASM tasks in which we do forecasting  <br>Focus on current state of the art of Python in WASM - possible performance improvement in production deployments of time-series models|
