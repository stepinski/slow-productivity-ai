Data Science team methodology description.

Phase 1
steps:
 1) problem definition
 2) data preparation (sample)
 3) spot check algorithm
 
 outcomes:
 - problem statement
 - metric definition
 - feasibility test on sample data - defined metric/score and limitations of next phase

Phase 2
steps:
1) data preparation ( obtain, scrub, explore)
model creation: 
3) spot checks algorithms 
4) improve results:
	* algorithm tunning
	* ensamble methods
	* feature tunning
5) Present results (interpretation)

outcome:
- report with scoring based on metric from phase 1
- model selected in step 4 is going to be deployed in production environment
