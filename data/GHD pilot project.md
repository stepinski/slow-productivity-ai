utility spend a lot of money not knowing where to replace pipes
-looking ways to where do they start / where to replace 

remaining asset life for pipe
"we will use your existing"

pressure data in your network - you see spike on timeseries data - 
same spike is in upstream logger and downstream logger
-understand the data - the lag - to determine what is the pressure way
-> time delta -> analysis (not for us) - determine the remaining wall thickness

can we find a way to automatically flag in the data - hey tere is the spike in the data
-> 100 cycles/second
hey there is a spike that meets the criteria and in downstream is the same -> we think it's related and we calculate time delta between upstream and downstream


5 seconds difference
-> do you collect the data in batches on streaming = realtime?



- Introduce the concept of transient events in pressure monitoring data
- Review example(s) of how these are currently identified by hand
- Discuss what datasets are involved
- Next steps
