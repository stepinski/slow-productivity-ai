plan and estimation

### plan for client's requests

-  visual data editor - easy to test - offer them  to use it for correction of april data
- Tesler as formula editor is better for us (functions are self documenting and revertable) - easy to use by them - we can ask them to start using it from day 1

### estimation
- inline edition within FW ( TODO estimation for MM but in my opinion it's challenging)
- estimation of new model - 
ds team (piotr, magda, dominika)
  2-3 dev sprints
  1-2 test - adjustment sprints
  min 3 sprints
  max 5 sprints
