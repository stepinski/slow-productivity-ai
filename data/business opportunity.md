- we work with partners to identify their key problem ( like infinitii ai)
- we create the AI app to solve this problem and offer it to them / others in the industry
- flowworks or dataworks are too general - for the whole industry  - are rather platforms to ship specific apps for industries.
- specific apps are IandI, Level predict tool, qaqc has not yet well defined app - Montreal might be the use case
- tesler is not a product itself - it's rather a devops tool to easily deploy ML. - eventually it's our way to get ideas for Ai apps, not a monetizable product itself
