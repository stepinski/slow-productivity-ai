Enel Green Power  
  
The work with Enel Green Power’s hydroelectric plants in Italy is a compelling example of delivering innovative predictive maintenance solutions that will lower maintenance costs and transform the performance, reliability and energy efficiency. The solution will enable a third of the units to move from hours-based maintenance to predictive and condition-based maintenance, leveraging ABB Ability™ Genix APM.  
  
Collaborating closely since early 2018, the ABB and Enel have jointly developed and tested predictive maintenance and advanced solutions via a pilot on five Enel plants in Italy and Spain, including Presenzano, a 1,000-megawatt plant near Naples. The solution includes digital software solutions and services that will provide analysis of over 190,000 signals and the deployment of about 800 digital asset models, aimed at improving plant operational performance, reducing unplanned failures and enabling more efficient planned maintenance practices through predictive maintenance. The integration is expected to yield savings in fleet maintenance costs and increase plant productivity, with the added reliability expected to have a substantial impact on OPEX, with maintenance savings of between 10% across the fleet and 2% increased generation capacity
