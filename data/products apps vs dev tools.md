* we cannot place ourselves this way:
"we are not sm experts, we deliver platform and cooperate with experts"
this way we try to sell infrastructure and dev tools - impossible especially in industrial companies

* we shall use FCG to generate knowledge for different areas - what is their problem to solve and try to build app for this particular problem

* IandI is the app in this sense but it's not shipable by itself - we need a tesler version thc to be able to deliver it as an app ( thc needs to be structured to do this)
* tesler as dev tool shall be rather opensourced or delivered for free - it's only the way to deliver solutions to companies 
* we need to focus on solutions

- [ ] each data science action is a project in itself - we need to do requirements gathering for 1 week before we even start to work with the data - means that we need to setup a call with technical insider, trying to understand the problem (why they do qaqc) and properly address value preposition 
- [ ] for each new industry/vertical we need to figure out the value preposition - it's not in FW, nor in Grafana, nor Tesler , neither Kaggle examples - nothing like that
- [ ] the idea of moving to different verticals in questionable - why we're in water in the first place is thanks to KWL and their value preposition - value was in project they deployed through FlowWorks, not the FW itself - alone it's trurly simple version of SCADA. 
- [ ] map - K2 or something is not a value in itself - this partnership for us makes sense only if we have an access to thier clients with our software - without it there is no value in anoher GIS tool - in terms of predictive maintenance -the same - no value
