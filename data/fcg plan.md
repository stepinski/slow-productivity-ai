## 1. montreal walves example - show in FW / Tesler

*TODO: test montreal in Tesler and add link here


## 2. pump example - show in FW / Tesler

*TODO: add link to pump example - get feedback from the team

Greg's material: https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/23/4014
part describing dataset:
The pump dataset with disproportionate data was taken from Kaggle. This dataset contains vibration data from 52 pumps across various time periods. This is a labeled dataset with three classes, namely broken, normal and recovering. The failure data are very scarce. Hence, the machine is considered to be in recovering state until it resumes normal operation. This is a measure to balance the distribution of data among multiple labels. The performance analysis of the classification using M-CBMI was validated using precision, recall, F-measure, AUC and accuracy.


here art - uses the same example - says something about it: https://becominghuman.ai/predict-pump-failure-before-it-happens-using-deep-learning-model-dc886bfa073e but less than in greg's
## 3. air pressure

*TODO: try to mix Greg's dataset descriptions with example that I've found

my example:

https://www.kaggle.com/code/thiagogalbiattivespa/air-compressor-maintenance-predictions/notebook

extremely bad example!!
- we should go with greg's + his py code but try finding best correlation and predict with linear regression - after selecting what is best correlated with air pressure ( is this something we want to predict?) - using similar eda as in school example
