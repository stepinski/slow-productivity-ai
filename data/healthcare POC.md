Good morning Chris and Happy New Year!
Further to our LI exchanges, I’m pleased to introduce Frank Carzoli and Greg Johnston at Infinitii.ai

I would very much like to schedule a brief intro mtg as an opportunity to exchange info from both sides and to explore perspectives of collaboration:

1.  Combining ML AI with data collection/management platforms and a broader expansion into the eclinical space
2.  How can ML AI augment/differentiate TrialStat’s capabilities in terms of predictive analysis and future event forecasting on clinical studies
3.  What type of data could be suitable for such advanced analyses and what the advantages could be for the end Sponsor?
4.  Flexible, low risk collaboration possibilities between two right sized innovative providers based in Canada, a captivating story in a very competitive segment…

## my plan
- [x] look for kaggle examples with sensors and predicting for instance heart attack
heart rate forecasting https://github.com/ChaithanyaVamshi/Heart_Rate_Time_Series_Forecasting
- [ ] publish in tesler similar to ABB
- [ ] ask Mike for creation of channels right away
## answers
- [ ] How can ML AI augment/differentiate TrialStat’s capabilities in terms of predictive analysis and future event forecasting on clinical studies
 ***makes research repeatable / testable / deployable  - results might be used as a service***
