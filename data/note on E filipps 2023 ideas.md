## rock-bottom method
- instead of focusing on final gols you focus on bare minimum
- after reaching bare minimum you rise the level up to next bare minimum
- you keep focus and motivation starting from white paper each time

## todo list
- prepare todo list each day dumping any tasks from your head ( also previous day)
- having todo in random order to the left 
- create "not to do" list to the right - anything you don't want to do today
- the less and more important things remains on todo side the better and more focused you are
- you also keep track of undone things 

## no weakness
- instead of focusing on weaknesses and keep investing your effort into my weak part (managing tasks, being on time, procastination, proactivity) focus on my strengths
- invest my effort into strengths and this is going to be a driver for all the rest - keeping me focused and happy


## todo
- find my strengths in terms of work / projects/ responsibilities and try to develop those parts
- create todo/nottodo list for today (rest of the day)
- create rock-bottom ideas for remaining week time
