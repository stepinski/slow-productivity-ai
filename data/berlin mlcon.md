Wasm is a rising technology that might be a very important piece of the puzzle in MLOps: deployment of predictive models through modules in containerless architectures. In this talk, I'm going to focus on 
- challenges in time-series processing MLops pipelines, where the short cold starts and performance given by WASM might be crucial.
- I'm going to introduce these advantages, illustrate them with examples of code from my own project, the open source Wasm Module Runner, benchmark several examples of time-series processing tasks, and 
- try to drive some conclusions and predictions on the way technology is going to evolve.
