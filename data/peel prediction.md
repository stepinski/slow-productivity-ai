- Some notes:

The last year of data at 1782535 may not be useable for training purposes. Might be better off using the historical data at 1782538-EM-Lincolnshire Blvd which is on FlowWorks. However, it is missing the historical rainfall which we can fix. 

The GARR pixels involved are in the layers attached. 

The rain gauge data is in FlowWorks. 

Let me know whose email to send a link to for the GARR data and I can have Mike Faye send the link to them.

I’ll be off starting tomorrow, returning Monday May 6th, and can touch base with you upon my return. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can reach out to Mahsa.
