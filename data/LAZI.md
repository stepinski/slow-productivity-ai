- productivity system by [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bry8a_7b9aM)
- L is for Lash -> calendar
- A is for agenda -> todo
- Z is for zetelkasten
- I is for inventory -> keep all the stuff 

for me it's something very similar to what I'm doing -> the difference is in cloud -> i have several clouds and only the most important I keep on Gdrive.
I'd like to use todo's in obsidian -> need to check what's possible -> cannot afford the dataview way to list tasks - it's too little as I list notes only there I need to list particular tasks on notes
