## **Project Overview**
### **Goal**:

To make FACE Pro our main ETL tool, replacing our custom data gatherers. This will centralize and automate data ingestion, making it easier for our team to manage pipelines and giving customers the power to handle their own data.

### **Internal Benefits**:

1. **Simplified Management**:  
    By moving all data ingestion pipelines to FACE Pro, everything will be managed in one place. It’ll be easier for us to configure and monitor, instead of dealing with separate custom apps.
    
2. **Automation**:  
    Right now, our custom apps require manual setup for each data source. With FACE Pro, these pipelines will be automated, saving us time and reducing manual work.
    
3. **Better Monitoring**:  
    Having all pipelines centralized means we can monitor everything from one dashboard. This will help us spot and fix issues faster.
    
4. **Scalability**:  
    FACE Pro will make it easier to scale. We’ll be able to handle more data sources with less hassle and integrate public data sources into our product more easily.

### **External Benefits**:

1. **Customer Control**:  
    With FACE Pro, customers can set up and ingest their own data without needing us to intervene. This will give them more flexibility and reduce our support load.
    
2. **"Virtual Sites" (Public Data)**:  
    We’ll be able to offer access to public data sources we collect—“virtual sites.” Customers can use this data for free, but once they start using it for calculations, we can charge them for the new data channel.
    
3. **Future Potential**:  
    By turning FACE Pro into an ETL tool, we’re setting ourselves up for future growth. We’ll be able to expand into new product lines that use more diverse data sources.
