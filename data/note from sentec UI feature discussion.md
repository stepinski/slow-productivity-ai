- presented Dopminika's mockup project
- we agreed that it's a generally good idea
- we want to have a way to push Markup code to function description to make possible to add some more informative function description like company logo, information who to contact in case of issue/questions - links to further documentation
- we want the function diagram to be place as a first item - just after the function description 
- we want to be able to select securit group at function saving step
- after having new version ( made by D. B. ) we're going to be ready to have a meeting with Sentec and discuss this approach
