most important meeting

[
    "It's just that.",
    "So, So what? We will start",
    "with this presenting?",
    "Presenting the other report",
    "for you guys. That'd be great.",
    "Sorry, I was late. I started, uh,",
    "working at the office again and it's a",
    "surprisingly easy to get to describe,",
    "distracted a lot more than from home.",
    "OK, so you see my screen, UM?",
    "It's not the most pretty report,",
    "but essentially what this says is a.",
    "We've looked at thermostats data",
    "and metering the main meters data.",
    "The main meters are mostly correct.",
    "There's a few things like",
    "putting a threshold for maximum",
    "values that don't make sense,",
    "but essentially it's showing",
    "that everything seems alright.",
    "And then you have the",
    "the data for thermostats.",
    "That's a little bit more problematic here.",
    "What you see is the the the",
    "availability of of the data for",
    "thermostats and the the frequency.",
    "So you see that you know we have a lot of",
    "thermostats that are the data is available.",
    "You know less less than 50% of the time,",
    "but at the same time as",
    "we discussed last time,",
    "that's not necessarily a problem,",
    "because you don't expect your",
    "thermostats to be.",
    "Running all over the time, right?",
    "So we don't know which part of this curve is",
    "normal or expected and which part is just.",
    "Uhm? Actually missing.",
    "So that's a bit of the profile that",
    "we have for for availability of data,",
    "and I think when they",
    "say availability is not,",
    "it's just this is their data there for",
    "a particular time in point of time.",
    "Come.",
    "What else? We have some devices",
    "that are a kind of like phantom",
    "devices that seem to get created",
    "and don't have any data ever,",
    "so we need to filter that out.",
    "We have some minimal values that",
    "don't don't quite make sense.",
    "And also maximal values again that we",
    "don't know where they're coming from.",
    "We're thinking that what happens",
    "is that the the thermostats.",
    "If there's a communication",
    "problem with the gateway.",
    "Sometimes the thermostat will just when",
    "the communication is reestablished,",
    "it'll just dump everything and then",
    "it shows us consumption all at once.",
    "But it's we have to find some way to.",
    "Spread that out over the time period where",
    "there was the the gap in communication,",
    "so that's probably what the",
    "maximum values are.",
    "My and. Yeah, we looked at,",
    "you know the ratio between thermostat",
    "and the and the total consumption,",
    "but that's I don't think that's any worry.",
    "And then where it becomes interesting",
    "for anomaly detection is we",
    "see that our gap filling here.",
    "Doesn't make any sense.",
    "If you notice, we have some",
    "patterns like this a happening,",
    "and there's absolutely no like there's no",
    "reason for for the pattern to look like this,",
    "and we don't know what's",
    "the what's creating it.",
    "So that's 11 issue that was just recently.",
    "Presented. And we we were just at the",
    "beginning of finding this issue and",
    "figuring out what it is and how to fix it.",
    "Uhm? Yeah, and this is where you see.",
    "So we have data for a calculated data",
    "based on the differential between",
    "you know the the accumulation.",
    "OK so the thermostat will accumulate the",
    "consumption over time and then we have",
    "another set of data that calculates the",
    "difference between time zed and time Y to",
    "see what was the consumption over that time.",
    "Period, right?",
    "So it's the difference",
    "between energy and power.",
    "And if you do,",
    "the difference between both,",
    "you see that here there's.",
    "There's the gaps that",
    "are represented by this.",
    "It's the it's the gap filling",
    "that seems to be happening",
    "quite a little bit strange.",
    "Uhm? Yeah, just the the higher values happen.",
    "Glad that context we are doing.",
    "We are trying to do some gut feeling on",
    "our data but it's not good enough, yeah?",
    "We have the two sets of data,",
    "the row one and the one calculated",
    "with the the gap feeding.",
    "Sorry yeah, and see here.",
    "It's the numbers that don't make sense.",
    "It's the same as I was.",
    "I was saying there's no way of",
    "knowing if when we have when",
    "you have a really high value.",
    "If it's an anomaly or if it's just a",
    "like a sum of all the the previous.",
    "Uh, consumption that wasn't recorded,",
    "and then it just dumps all at once,",
    "so you have to some so we don't know if",
    "it's an anomaly or something that we",
    "need to spread over a certain period of time.",
    "A quick question the the data is it across",
    "all hilow users or is it a subset of?",
    "Of the Halo users, what we're seeing?",
    "No, it's it's a I don't know if",
    "I have the proportion anywhere.",
    "I think it's it's all over the users,",
    "but uh, it's a period of time,",
    "not the whole historical data.",
    "It's OK one month data or two months of data.",
    "That's it, but I think it's all the users.",
    "The problem the problem was happening",
    "frequently across all users.",
    "For for the thermostat, one for the meters.",
    "We don't see a lot of problems.",
    "For the thermostat seems more frequent.",
    "Yeah, so we have just things",
    "that we can't really explain,",
    "but at the same time when you",
    "say what we saw the distribution",
    "of when we don't have any,",
    "it's not that one when we don't",
    "have any data for the thermostats,",
    "so it's really high,",
    "but then we don't have any way to measure.",
    "Are those missing values versus just normal?",
    "Because we don't.",
    "We can't really validate if",
    "people are are heating or not,",
    "but I think there's a few ways",
    "that we could dig into this and",
    "and figure out if there's an",
    "issue or not because we have,",
    "you know,",
    "temperature values and some things",
    "that could give us a clue as to",
    "whether the thermostat stopped.",
    "You know the heating",
    "stopped or there's an issue.",
    "So that's it for. So why we?",
    "We really we have those kind of issues.",
    "It's because we have a couple of",
    "bottleneck in the in the in the",
    "pipeline of how the data is coming from",
    "the thermostat until our data basis,",
    "for example to explain it,",
    "it's we have a thermostat which",
    "is connected to a gateway.",
    "And the and the protocol is Zigbee protocol.",
    "And then the gateway is connected",
    "to the Internet and then from",
    "from the gateway we will receive.",
    "We will receive the the the data.",
    "So for example, if the thermostat",
    "is disconnected from the gateway,",
    "we will lose data. And for example.",
    "For for, for the uh, for the, uh,",
    "gateway sometimes when there is like a.",
    "Electricity, uh goes down, I think.",
    "Also we will lose that. Uh, so, uh?",
    "It depends on the electricity",
    "and the Internet and the Zigbee.",
    "So that's why.",
    "And also as already said,",
    "sometimes it's natural that the",
    "thermostat doesn't send any data",
    "because it's not not working,",
    "it's not heating when when the",
    "thermostat is not heating it will",
    "stand one heartbeat every hour.",
    "So and that's it. How, how?",
    "How does how?",
    "How does it look like when when you",
    "have this electricity issue and",
    "you have no access to a Internet",
    "you you are not able to to send?",
    "Uh, send data through Zigbee?",
    "Uh,",
    "this data is somehow collected",
    "locally and then it's it's being",
    "sent as soon as you have connection",
    "again or if there is no it will,",
    "it will stop sending data at all.",
    "We will stop thermal standing after",
    "after everything is right again.",
    "You have a batch of the past",
    "data or it's one batch.",
    "Or else it will float if lost, it's lost.",
    "OK, there's no local.",
    "There's no local story.",
    "Yeah, OK?",
    "There is no electricity",
    "for the thermostat work,",
    "so there is there is nothing.",
    "Well, this is one and.",
    "The other the other,",
    "the other possibility that we",
    "lose data is that the Zigbee",
    "connection is not working.",
    "And where is the gateway?",
    "Is that physically it's physically distinct?",
    "Is it on a pole?",
    "So it's in the house, it's in the house,",
    "it's like, oh, I see so.",
    "So the thermostat and the meter are",
    "both connected to the to the gateway.",
    "Yeah, and yeah, I think in some houses",
    "when when it's a really big house",
    "and you'll have like 1 thermostat,",
    "that's way far in the in the garage.",
    "For example, you can have",
    "some communication problems.",
    "So in the last last thing that we,",
    "uh, had as an issue, is the so.",
    "The as I said, the thermostat will",
    "will sum up all of its consumption",
    "during the day and just kind of like",
    "incrementally increase that number,",
    "but then it's it's doing a reset",
    "every every day at midnight UM,",
    "which is something a little like.",
    "It's a little bit odd,",
    "it's just the way they were created,",
    "because if you look at a meter like",
    "a a meter for your electricity,",
    "it's never gonna reset, but those resets,",
    "so that's a bit of a challenge",
    "because you have to really.",
    "Identify when they did the reset to",
    "make sure you're not missing anything.",
    "UM, and we do have quite a",
    "significant number of of, uh,",
    "thermostats that do a reset, not at.",
    "Midnight UM, and that can be",
    "because there was some issue with,",
    "uh, if I think there.",
    "If there's no electricity at some point,",
    "they're gonna.",
    "They're gonna do a restart.",
    "There's a bunch of moments when",
    "they they can do a restart,",
    "so if you can, if you can identify that,",
    "restart and just make sure it's",
    "correct for it, it's fine.",
    "It's just when you have a restart",
    "paired with a lack of data.",
    "That's an issue because if you",
    "if you have a gap,",
    "let's say at the period where",
    "it's doing the restart,",
    "then you don't know.",
    "You can't really deduce from when it's",
    "starting again what was the number right?",
    "I don't know if it's clear,",
    "but if you're you're you're doing this",
    "something like this and then you just",
    "have a piece of information missing.",
    "But it's including a reset.",
    "It's really hard to gap fill.",
    "Are there on a sink on a single device?",
    "Other resets fix like you",
    "said sometimes at midnight,",
    "but with that a device that appears",
    "to always reset at midnight when",
    "it's maybe sometimes reset it",
    "5:00 PM or something as well.",
    "Yeah, that's it.",
    "Yeah, you can have one reset more than once.",
    "During a day.",
    "Is that based on a quote like the",
    "accumulator filling and then it's like OK,",
    "my I've filled and I got it restart.",
    "No, it's it's no it could get,",
    "it could count to 100 and then reset.",
    "Or it could count to 50 and reset.",
    "Yeah, it's not that.",
    "It's not that because sometimes you",
    "see it resetting when it's lower",
    "than what it was the day before,",
    "so it's definitely not that.",
    "So it it randomly resets buttressed.",
    "What reset exactly means is only",
    "a counseling,",
    "a accumulative accumulated",
    "amount or something like that.",
    "Yeah, and not not like the timestamp is OK.",
    "Yeah, timestamp is.",
    "Yeah it's just going back to zero and",
    "starting like it's incrementation at zero,",
    "but it's it's when it's paired with",
    "a gap in our data, or missing data,",
    "that's it becomes really.",
    "Gotcha.",
    "Are the other devices like time",
    "synchronized like these NTP or",
    "something to keep their clock?",
    "Or can their clocks?",
    "I I heard I I I learned this week that",
    "they don't have an Internet clock so.",
    "I think that the gateway have the",
    "gateway determines the timestamp.",
    "Yeah, the thermostat doesn't know which is.",
    "Yeah, yeah. Ever since. Yeah.",
    "David, you are mute.",
    "Gateway is is it connected directly to",
    "you or to the consumers Internet access?",
    "Consumer Internet access.",
    "OK, so goes through the broadband.",
    "So yeah, so this is the the",
    "issues that we have. Uhm, and uh,",
    "regarding to the last to the last meeting",
    "we talked internally with our team with",
    "the teams involved on the gut feeling and",
    "one of the subject that came up is that.",
    "It will be better if we have if we",
    "host the solution. I don't know.",
    "What is your flexibility about that?",
    "Because now we have the thermostat,",
    "but tomorrow we will have",
    "the charging stations.",
    "We will have other types of. Devices and.",
    "We need maybe to a standardized in our end",
    "or play with with the with the solution to.",
    "To adapt it to the to the rest",
    "of the devices. So one of the.",
    "Subjects is if it's possible to",
    "host in our and if it's possible",
    "to get the expertise to in our end,",
    "so I know.",
    "Is it for for you guys you provide",
    "only the API or only the the",
    "computer in your hand and we need",
    "to communicate with you?",
    "Or is there a possibility that",
    "we get the expertise to do so?",
    "Yeah, so you will be able to.",
    "You would like to have a",
    "access to the tool and to do.",
    "And going out for this is this",
    "is like an example I have.",
    "We have that assigned uh in the team and, uh.",
    "We want to the data science to",
    "have like some control on the",
    "solution to to play with it.",
    "I don't know if it's possible",
    "or are you open to that?",
    "So last time you. Presented 2",
    "different paths here and one was",
    "more API centric and another was more",
    "involved. Way more integration but",
    "in the second in the second option.",
    "You could have access to.",
    "Our platform in which we deploy a",
    "deploy the solution and it looks like",
    "for your data science team it looks",
    "like an environment when you can you",
    "have control over the code basically.",
    "So you can, uh, you can.",
    "Change anything you want in in Python code.",
    "Yeah, that's the that's that's",
    "the possibility that I said.",
    "We have a tool. Basically we don't.",
    "It's not.",
    "It's not a custom binary where",
    "we how we deploy a models.",
    "It's it's we deploy everything through",
    "through this this tool which has both",
    "API access where you can control the",
    "code and sources and also UI access.",
    "So you could have access",
    "to the portal it's not.",
    "Uh, it's not us, you know?",
    "Coder friendly as a SUS notebook,",
    "as you put a notebook,",
    "but through this tool you can.",
    "You can edit your code in your",
    "in your environment in your,",
    "in your own IDE and you know and",
    "synced it with this with this tool.",
    "Basically that's there.",
    "But the computer it's on your side or",
    "we can have the computer in our side.",
    "Not, uh, so this this question.",
    "So in my in my uh, in my solution,",
    "uh, in the in the thing that we",
    "prepared for the previous meeting.",
    "It was on our side so it's, uh, uh.",
    "The integration was like.",
    "You stream the data to our models,",
    "models, leaves on our in in this tool.",
    "And you will have output and you",
    "have it output it to your whatever",
    "destination you have and if it's",
    "possible to have a custom deployment",
    "of this whole environment in Hilo,",
    "it's not a question.",
    "To me.",
    "It's rather its third way and 3rd path",
    "that we we haven't discussed internally,",
    "so I",
    "will take that.",
    "You know that that's your kind of plan.",
    "A would be to host the compute host",
    "every the model, host everything.",
    "We can, we can kind of discuss that",
    "internally and see if that if that's",
    "a possibility, if that makes sense.",
    "If that works so.",
    "Is is there a it is Plan B the the",
    "the one that pyott described a",
    "possibility or is that just a non starter or?",
    "Uhm? It's, let's say it's a must.",
    "Right? Alright.",
    "To be transparent and, uh,",
    "yeah it's a it's a must we? Uh.",
    "We want to to have like some a big part of",
    "the expertise because we we know it will.",
    "It will be like usage.",
    "Like forever with the we",
    "will have this this problem.",
    "This connectivity problems we",
    "will have them forever, you know.",
    "So.",
    "So I think part of what we have is next",
    "steps, then Nope, Russians attempt.",
    "I think we should come back with a proposal.",
    "To address this problem statement,",
    "UM and I think maybe it be worthwhile",
    "hearing from you just just a summary",
    "of what the problem statement is.",
    "But we come back with.",
    "Uh, a proposal and I know that.",
    "I missed the first meeting that",
    "David from Mohan with David St.",
    "John may. I think David St.",
    "John wanted to be involved.",
    "At a certain stage when we,",
    "when we kind of review, discover",
    "together and come up with this proposal.",
    "So we, we should you know we,",
    "we should factor that in as well.",
    "But, uh, I think we we should come back with.",
    "Not with that info, but just for, UM, UM.",
    "Or for our benefit, could you just",
    "sort of two or three sentences,",
    "summarize the problem?",
    "That way we we have it crystal.",
    "Clamp or no?",
    "I know you've just described it,",
    "but if it's if you wouldn't mind,",
    "is it possible to have",
    "access to to the document?",
    "OK, perhaps sharing some",
    "part of it I don't know.",
    "Yeah, that's part of it because",
    "the the document it doesn't belong",
    "to ILU belong to, it'll Quebec.",
    "Check that, I guess that there is",
    "no way to have access to to the",
    "data set that is based for charts.",
    "Uh, I think that with the NDA,",
    "I think we can through the NDA I",
    "can I can I can check with the with",
    "the legal department because if",
    "we need to give you that will be",
    "like the the production you know.",
    "Yeah, because then I had some some some I I.",
    "I appreciate your presentation.",
    "But for instance if you know having",
    "the data I would be able to understand",
    "natural pattern or something like",
    "that because here I saw something",
    "strange but I would like I don't",
    "even know how it looks like.",
    "It's like yeah, yeah, yeah.",
    "The data is as little big we.",
    "No, we can send an extract a like a sample.",
    "It would be a sample,",
    "even a month or something.",
    "Yeah, yeah, for whatever possible",
    "a couple of gigs per month.",
    "I'm sorry I had to cry and I I don't.",
    "Sorry David, don't you ask that question?",
    "I did have a follow up.",
    "I'm one thing that I I wasn't clear can you?",
    "We talked about the problems in the data and",
    "the ability to identify these these different",
    "kinds of problems in the challenge Canada.",
    "Is this something that and human",
    "sitting down in front of the data set?",
    "Can they identify it by looking at it or",
    "like assuming they have the correlation suit?",
    "You could take.",
    "You can guess at it,",
    "maybe sometimes yes,",
    "sometimes no because.",
    "Sometimes you will have a gap of two hours,",
    "yeah?",
    "He doesn't know what happened",
    "in these two hours.",
    "The let's say correct me",
    "if I'm wrong or deal,",
    "but the the the the goal of it is to",
    "calculate the amount of energy that was",
    "consumed on those two hours, you know.",
    "Uh, and uh, yeah human will not is it?",
    "Is it really Zigbee problem?",
    "Is it really electricity?",
    "Is it Internet?",
    "We don't know.",
    "So the idea is to is to understand",
    "when you have these gaps too.",
    "It's it's obviously to classify",
    "the problem and so that you can",
    "decide whether you should certain",
    "problems or are legitimate.",
    "Hey, the powers down,",
    "no energy is being consumed,",
    "but if you were able to identify well the",
    "the classify this problem is this kind.",
    "You could then fill this",
    "gap using some message.",
    "Some method you have,",
    "but perhaps you know you could",
    "fill the data and then you could",
    "actually get that estimate,",
    "estimate the actual consumption",
    "based on feelings.",
    "So is that the problem statement?",
    "What Mike just said is that a good proxy?",
    "Summary of what what?",
    "The yeah?",
    "OK yeah, identify if the gap is",
    "normal or not and if it's not why?",
    "And and depending on the Y,",
    "can we fill it?",
    "And do you have in the data set?",
    "Do you have also the outside outside",
    "the temperature and something like that",
    "so that it's a different data set?",
    "It's not.",
    "It's not that we have the.",
    "We can have the internal a temperature.",
    "Yeah, you can have the set point",
    "and the internal temperature.",
    "OK so you don't have any kind of you don't",
    "know what is the temperature outside.",
    "No. Do you have Geo?",
    "Are they geolocated?",
    "You have like coordinates for each device?",
    "In a different data set.",
    "It it seems like it.",
    "You know it's something that",
    "that could be acquired.",
